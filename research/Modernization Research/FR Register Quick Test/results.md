# Modernization Concept Designs Test Results

## Hypotheses Tested (Tl;DR)

Do agency partners prefer an automated FR feed, a hybrid process, or stay with the manual FR Feed and review?

## Participants

- **FDMS Concepts**: 5 regulatory agency staff (of various agency size) from our eRulemaking Innovation Team

## We reverse the process with our automation design concepts

Our initial designs approached, from a well meaning place, a way to automate the pull of a FR document which would then create the docket. **This isn't how the process works as it turns out.** Dockets need to be created and will sometime sit as blanks until the agency is ready to pull in an offical FR document from the manual list. 

We took that into account a re-engineered the concepts to reflect reality, which then resonated with users.

## Keep the FR Feed manual please

When asked if we could remove the FR feed/table from FDMS and automate the pull of documents into their respective dockets, the answer was a resounding **No**. Agencies prefer to search for, verify, and then pull in the FR document â€” they do not trust an automated process to be able to sort the documents to the right place. 

We respect that sentiment, but still wonder if there is a hybrid solution...the pull is still automated, but the placement of the FR document isn't final until a designated or assigned agency user verifies it's location, metadata, etc. 

## Why it matters:

Searching, verifying, and assigning FR documents into the right place is laborious and repetitive. If we can find a hybrid solution that allows users to only verify the information, we could save everyone time and increase efficiency.
