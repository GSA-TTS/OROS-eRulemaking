# Modernized Concept Design Plan - September Iterations

## Goals

The team took the feedback from initial design concepts and impromptu 1:1's with a small sample of agencies and interated on the FDMS designs to emulate FDMS v4 with some modifications. We now want to verify that our design direction to emulate FDMS v4 is correct before we expend any more energy and have to pivot.

### FDMS Iterations Questions/Assumptions ###

1. Evaluate our design philosophpy/understanding of docket management, document management, and phase changes
2. Evaluate FR feed verification and document assignment
3. Evaluate bulk change view
4. Evaluate comment management view
5. Evaluate tabbed "scenarios" concept
6. Evaluate screen real estate and workflow efficiency

## Methods

- Moderated 1:1's interviews with informal discussion, walkthroughs of interface concepts, no task based questions
- Agency participants sourced from eRulemaking Innovation Group (EPA, DOT, DOL, FWS, DHS, SSA, ED, HHS)
