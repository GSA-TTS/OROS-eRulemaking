# Initial Modernized Concept Design Plan

## Goals

The team spent the prior month creating a wide set of initial concepts with medium fidelity wireframes for the future Regulations.gov and FDMS. We want to get a baseline understanding of how effective these concepts are in demonstrating our understanding of the core capabilities of each platform.

###Regulations.gov Core Capabilities Questions/Assumptions###

1. Evaluate our design philosophpy/understanding of the core capabilities
2. Evaluate overall navigation
3. Evaluate search and search results

## Methods

- Unmoderated, remote task based testing using Optimal Workshop's "First Click" test
