# Modernization Concept Designs Test Results

## Hypotheses Tested (Tl;DR)

1. For our Regulations.gov designs, do power users understand how to navigate and search for information? **Yes**
2. For our FDMS designs, can agency perform their work faster and more efficienctly? **No, and we're back to the drawing board on this.**

## Participants

- **Public/Regulations.gov concepts**: 7 American Association of Law Librarians members from across the country
- **FDMS Concepts**: 14 regulatory agency staff (of various agency size) from our eRulemaking Innovation Team

## Regulations.gov designs ring true for power users

We attempted to test our initial and overall approach to what a re-designed Regulations.gov would look like â€” the wireframes and tasks covered site navigation, search and filtering, commenting, and user preferences/settings.

- Users felt that the design of the home page was more efficient than the current design, with the ability to jump into an advanced search or filter by agency right off the bat being a highlight:
  
> *This wireframe centers what I would mainly come to regulations.gov for: searching. I like the "trending regulations" section on this front page as well--if I'm being asked to research something that is in the news, the trending section may surface that faster than searching/browsing depending on how much information I have to start out. I also like the browse by topic/agency as an option that I can navigate to quickly. In the search bar it seems like there might be a button to better filter results (by agency etc.), and if there's not, that would be very useful.*

- Search could use more specific identifiers/signifiers to orient users to what they are searching for, but some of this was deemed to be feedback about the wireframe construction instead of the wireframe concept

> *It appears from the last page that supporting documents and comments are not seen until the user chooses that docket. That would suggest that the user already knows what they are looking for. In the event that they do not, are these items viewable and seen before they choose that docket?*

> *I like that the phase of the rulemaking is clearly shown at the top. In the current regulations.gov there are also tabs for Unified Agenda information as well as a tab for comments, so this information would be helpful to have on this page as well, since we are looking at an overview of the docket-related information.*

## FDMS designs were a reversion of functionality: decreasing readiblity, effiency, and the ability to process a high volume of documents/comments
