# Modernization Concept Designs Test Results

## Hypotheses Tested (Tl;DR)

1. For our Regulations.gov designs, do power users understand how to navigate and search for information? **Yes**
2. For our FDMS designs, can agency perform their work faster and more efficienctly? **No, and we're back to the drawing board on this.**

## Participants

- **Public/Regulations.gov concepts**: 7 American Association of Law Librarians members from across the country
- **FDMS Concepts**: 14 regulatory agency staff (of various agency size) from our eRulemaking Innovation Team

## Regulations.gov designs ring true for power users

We attempted to test our initial and overall approach to what a re-designed Regulations.gov would look like — the wireframes and tasks covered site navigation, search and filtering, commenting, and user preferences/settings.

- Users felt that the design of the home page was more efficient than the current design, with the ability to jump into an advanced search or filter by agency right off the bat being a highlight:
  
> *This wireframe centers what I would mainly come to regulations.gov for: searching. I like the "trending regulations" section on this front page as well--if I'm being asked to research something that is in the news, the trending section may surface that faster than searching/browsing depending on how much information I have to start out. I also like the browse by topic/agency as an option that I can navigate to quickly. In the search bar it seems like there might be a button to better filter results (by agency etc.), and if there's not, that would be very useful.*

- Search could use more specific identifiers/signifiers to orient users to what they are searching for, but some of this was deemed to be feedback about the wireframe construction instead of the wireframe concept

> *It appears from the last page that supporting documents and comments are not seen until the user chooses that docket. That would suggest that the user already knows what they are looking for. In the event that they do not, are these items viewable and seen before they choose that docket?*

> *I like that the phase of the rulemaking is clearly shown at the top. In the current regulations.gov there are also tabs for Unified Agenda information as well as a tab for comments, so this information would be helpful to have on this page as well, since we are looking at an overview of the docket-related information.*

## FDMS designs were a reversion of functionality: decreasing readiblity, effiency, and the ability to process a high volume of documents/comments

It was immediate and obvious from the feedback we recieved from our agency partners that we missed the mark on our initial concepts for the mdoernized version of FDMS. Our initial assumptions we wanted to prove were based around reusing the designs and components we created for Regulations.gov to provide a more unified design approach.

### Larger components and diminished screen real estate frustrated users and was the antithesis to how they work

The chief complaint about the proposed designs revolved around our use of large status cards and an expansive, more consumer friendly home page to navigate around the site:

> *This will be impossible for me to manage my work flow, there's like 4 documents in the search return...I manage hundreds to thousands. If you released this I would be pretty pissed off.

**Noted**

### Shifting our attention to a solution by looking to the past and admiring the competitors of the future

We scrapped our initial designs and went on a mission to try and uncover screenshots or images of the old versions of FDMS, v3 and v4, which were and remain highly popular with users for its functionality and usability. 

With all hands on board, we dug up an archive and set to work to emulate the designs of v4, quickly iterating to re-work our core capability concept designs. 

We also looked to competitors for inspiration and ideas on how to increase screen real estate, reduce context switching, and increase workflow efficiency when performing discrete tasks in FDMS. We found a potential design pattern solution looking at data analytics platforms — tabs. We're now investigating using pop-out tabs within FDMS when a users wants to dive deep into what we are calling "scenarios" i.e. reviewing assigned comments, investgating a deduplication report, or eventually topic tagging processed comments. 

## Follow on interviews and studies are now ongoing to assess the potential of our FDMS v4 and tab based design concepts
