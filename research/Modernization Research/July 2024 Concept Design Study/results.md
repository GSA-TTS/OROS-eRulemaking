# Modernization Concept Designs Test Results

## Hypotheses Tested (Tl;DR)

1. For our Regulations.gov designs, do power users understand how to navigate and search for information? **Yes**
2. For our FDMS designs, can agency perform their work faster and more efficienctly? **No, and we're back to the drawing board on this.**

## Participants

- **Public/Regulations.gov concepts**: 7 American Association of Law Librarians members from across the country
- **FDMS Concepts**: 14 regulatory agency staff (of various agency size) from our eRulemaking Innovation Team

## Regulations.gov designs ring true for power users

We attempted to test our initial and overall approach to what a re-designed Regulations.gov would look like â€” the wireframes and tasks covered site navigation, search and filtering, commenting, and user preferences/settings.

- Users felt that the design of the home page was more efficient than the current design, with the ability to jump into an advanced search or filter by agency right off the bat being a highlight.
